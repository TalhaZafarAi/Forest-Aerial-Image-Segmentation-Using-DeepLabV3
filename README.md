## Forest Aerial Image Segmentation Using DeepLabV3 and Partial Cross-Entropy Loss
This project focuses on the segmentation of forest aerial images to detect specific regions of interest using a deep learning approach. The primary objective is to preprocess the dataset, implement a custom loss function, train a segmentation model, and experiment with different hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

### Features

- **Custom Loss Function**: Implements a Partial Cross-Entropy Loss to handle partial annotations.
- **DeepLabV3 Model**: Utilizes DeepLabV3 with a ResNet101 backbone for efficient and robust segmentation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes transformations and point annotation simulations for effective training.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiments with different learning rates and batch sizes to find the optimal configuration.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides a complete training loop with model evaluation and loss computation.

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- Pillow
- numpy
- torch
- torchvision
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/forest-aerial-image-segmentation.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

4. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Navigate to the location of your `Forest_Aerial_Segmentation.ipynb` file and click on it to open it. You can now run the code cells in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter.

5. If you specifically want to run the code in the notebook using Python outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can convert the notebook to a Python script:

    ```bash
    jupyter nbconvert --to script Forest_Aerial_Segmentation.ipynb
    ```

    This will create a .py file that you can then run using the `python` command. However, note that some functionalities of Jupyter Notebook, such as interactive widgets, may not work in a regular Python script.

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python Forest_Aerial_Segmentation.py
    ```

### Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Use the provided dataset and apply necessary transformations.
2. **Define and Compile Model**: Utilize the DeepLabV3 model with a custom Partial Cross-Entropy Loss.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the model using different hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using the specified metrics and visualize the results.
