# Forest-Aerial-Image-Segmentation-Using-DeepLabV3
This project focuses on the segmentation of forest aerial images to detect specific regions of interest using a deep learning approach. The primary objective is to preprocess the dataset, implement a custom loss function, train a segmentation model, and experiment with different hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
